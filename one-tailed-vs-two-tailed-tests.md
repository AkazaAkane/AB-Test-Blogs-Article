# One-tailed vs Two-tailed Tests

### Misconceptions

> “A one-tailed hypothesis, or directional hypothesis, **predicts** the actual DIRECTION in which the findings will go. It is more precise, and usually used when other research has been carried out previously, giving us a good idea of which way the results will go e.g. we predict more or less, an increase or decrease, higher or lower.
>
> A two-tailed hypothesis, or non-directional hypothesis, **predicts** an OPEN outcome thus the results can go in 2 directions. It is left very general and is usually used when no other research has been done before thus we do not know what will happen e.g. we predict a difference, an effect or a change but we do not know in what direction.”

### **Why we care**

The two-tailed test can show evidence that the control and variation are _different_, but the one-tailed test can show evidence if variation is _better than_ the control.

> In frequentist tests, you have a null hypothesis. The null hypothesis is what you believe to be true absent evidence to the contrary. **** Now suppose you’ve run a test and received a p-value. The p-value represents the probability of seeing a result at least that “extreme” in the event the null hypothesis were true. The lower the p-value, the less plausible it is that the null hypothesis is true.

> Now suppose you are A/B testing a control and a variation, and you want to measure the difference in conversion rate between both variants. The two-tailed test takes as a null hypothesis the belief that both variations have equal conversion rates.
>
> The one-tailed test takes as a null hypothesis the belief that the variation is not better than the control, but could be worse.

### Two-Tailed Tests Explained

A two-sided hypothesis and a two-tailed test should be used only when one would act the same way, or draw the same conclusions, if a statistically significant difference in any direction is discovered.
