# Unequal Sample Size

You can run an experiment with an unequal allocation (e.g. 10–90) as long as you don’t modify the allocation while the experiment is running. However it will be less efficient than a 50–50 allocation—either your test will have less power, or you will need to run it longer to achieve a comparable result. Do unequal sample sizes bias results?

We want our A/B test results to be an unbiased estimator of the true effect. To achieve this, we rely on randomized assignment to “spread out” the influence of confounding factors equally across variations, so that they do not influence our relative comparison of different or uplift between the variations. Even if the proportion of users assigned to each variation is unequal, randomized assignment still works as long as we don’t change the traffic split. You should never modify the traffic allocation mid-experiment, because this can introduce temporal bias into your results. 1 Are unequal sample sizes efficient? So it is possible to run an experiment with a non 50–50 split, but is it advisable? If our goal is to achieve some predetermined risk profile as quickly as possible—then probably not.

So a 10–90 allocation would require **2.8x** as many total users to reach a similar outcome as a 50–50 split. We can understand why this is the case by looking at the formula for the standard error of the difference between two binomial proportions, which defines the width of our confidence intervals.  A lower standard error equals greater certainty. The overall term will decrease whenever we collect samples in either variation, increasing either  or . But there are diminishing returns as  increases. Suppose we’ve already collected 1000 samples in variation A, but only 100 samples in variation B. Collecting an additional 100 samples in A will only half of the term under the square root by 10%, whereas an additional 100 samples in B would cut that term in half.
